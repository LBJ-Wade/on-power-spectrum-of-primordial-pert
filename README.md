on-power-spectrum-of-primordial-pert
===========================================================================

For any form of potential of inflaton, numerically solve the Mukharnov equation, i.e.,  the e.o.m. of the primordial scalar perturbation; and compute the power spectrum of it.

If you use the original definition of the z in Mukharnov equation, then 10 times of the time will be spent to obtain the same result.
